Readme - Learned Index Structure test implementation using python
=================================================================

This directory/folder contains the Python (v 3.7) files with four experimental setups with the Learned Index implemented in all of them. Their corresponding Colab Python Notebooks (.ipynb) with sample results are also saved in the same directory.

For all four files, the following three parameters can be changes in the code.

1. Distribution for generating dataset in line 17 to 21. Line 17 is uncommented by default for selecting "exponential" distribution.
2. Size of dataset, N in line 87.
3. Learning rate, lr in line 88.

* Line 122/124 can be uncommented to trace the convergence progress.
